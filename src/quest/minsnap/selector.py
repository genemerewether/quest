    Richter, Bry, Roy; Polynomial Trajectory Planning for Quadrotor Flight
    Equation 31

    This matrix maps between the partitioned arrangement of free and fixed
    derivatives, Eqn. 26, and the ordering in the constraint matrix, A.

    Args:
        der_fixed: Boolean array of n_der (max potential number of free
            derivatives per segment) x n_seg + 1 (one column per waypoint).
            Fixing a derivative at a waypoint is performed by setting the
            corresponding entry to True.
        order: the highest order of the polynomials used in the optimisation

    Returns:
        M: sparse selector matrix (nonsquare)
